	Okay you guys I'm gonna sing
	You this song right now
	This is a kind of a sweet song
	I sing it to my wife
	Because she let's me talk about so many things
	In front of you people
	And she doesn't even get mad at me
	She's pretty damn cool
	So here we go...
	I met you 20 years ago
	And we talked all night
	You drank me under the table
	Yeah, it was love at first sight
	I knew right then and there
	I'd grow old with you
	I said I'd tell you jokes whenever you are sad
	Make you a mom, if you made me a dad
	Oh, it's been so much fun
	Growing old with you
	Oh, oh
	I love you
	Foot rub you
	Tell you you're the only one I'm thinking of
	Make big decisions with you
	Try new positions with you
	Even sit and watch
	Fucking Eat Pray Love
	Two times in a row
	Now when I'm on a diet
	You take away my potatoes
	Say "Fuck all those guys"
	After reading Rotten Tomatoes
	I hope they all die miserable deaths
	As I grow old with you
	You scold me
	You hold me
	Look the other way
	When I dress like a pimp
	You cry to me
	You lie to me
	But only when you tell me
	That the dick looks big
	Now, we don't need a big house
	We don't need any money
	All we need is you and me
	And Sadie and Sunny
	I got everything I want
	Growing old with you
	Thanks for growing old with...
	Me
	Alright y'all, thank you so much
	Respect... rock & roll
	I love you too, let's do it again some time (thank you)
